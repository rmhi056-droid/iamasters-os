# PreCompact hook: fires right before Claude Code compacts the context in a long-running
# session. Without this, any tool events observed after the previous Stop and before the
# compaction happens can be dropped when compaction rewrites the transcript.
#
# Strategy: re-invoke _session-learner.sh (idempotent, gated by .last-learn) so any fresh
# observations are flushed to proposals before context is lost. Session-learner already
# handles its own locking and skips re-processing observations older than .last-learn.
#
# Runs sync with short timeout so compaction is not noticeably delayed.
